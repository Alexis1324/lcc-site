    <h2>I wuv my babies</h2>

    <p>So about my babies the oldest one is Ash. Don't tell the others but he's my favorite one :)
      I got him back in 2018. He is my favorite becuase he helped me with my depression. The middle kitty is Princess. She acts like she's the boss. The youngest Ava is the worst though. She acts like a dog and plays fetch with me i mean while i was making this she was bugging me to play with her and she stepped on my keyboard while i was trying to code. </p>

    <!-- the assignment sheet lists a bunch of different tags for text elements and basic formatting. i want you to fill in this document with all of those elements. 
    
    some of the tags are for actual text elements and some are inline, meaning you apply them inside of text elements. the following text element has an inline italic applied -->
